This tutorial explores Machine Learning using GPU-enabled PyTorch for applications in high energy physics.

It follows directly from the [Introduction to Machine Learning lesson](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-ml-webpage/) written by Meirin Evans.

Introduction
------------

For physicists working on analysis in data-intensive fields such as particle physics, it's quite common these days to start developing new machine learning applications. But many machine learning applications run more efficiently on GPU.

The aim of this lesson is to:
- demonstrate how to move an existing machine learning model onto a GPU
- discuss some of the common issues that come up when using machine learning applicaitons on GPUs

> ## The skills we'll focus on:
>
> 1.  Understanding a bit about GPUs
> 2.  Using Python & PyTorch to discover what kind of GPU is available to you 
> 3.  Moving a machine learning model onto the GPU
> 4.  Comparing the performance of the machine learning model between the CPU and the GPU
